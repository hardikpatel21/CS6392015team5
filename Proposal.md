# Introduction
This proposal provides a brief overview of a RSS reader, which will allow users to easily search for websites they need, and locate realted RSS feeds, provide a reading list of them and support a clean layout to read.  Once users have searched a website by URL, the searching RSS feed and organizing article process will be carried out in background.  This provides an easily accessible method for users to search and read articles they need, and to save time for users to look for their interest articles.

# Background
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. RSS is an easy way to share your website updates and content with your users so that users might not have to visit your site daily for any kind of updates. Frequently, users find it's time consuming to surf websites because they have experienced so much advertisment and unwantted information at one time.

RSS feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically. A standard XML file format ensures compatibility with many different machines/programs. RSS feeds also benefit users who want to receive timely updates from favourite websites or to aggregate data from many sites.

There are many similar RSS applications right now, such as Feedly, Readlbility etc.

# Goals
Our goal is to provide an easy and fast way to read useful information through a mobile device with clear and nice view of layout on it. We belive throught this project, we could have a deep understanding on the Android development and related technologies. We will use Android Studio to develop our project.

# Proposed Technologies
The RSS reader will run as an Android mobile phone application. We will practise techonologies skills, such as ListView, ArrayAdapter, Parse XML in Android, HTTP Request and Show WebSite Content in WebView in Android. 

# Out of Scope & Further Consideration
For the purposes of this project, our application will only fetch RSS feed for prototype. It will support full-text RSS feed converting feature in the future verison.
